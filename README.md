# What do we store?
We use our current data to estimate Slenders in popular genre games such as, Murder Mistery 2, and Ragdoll Engine. With our scripts, we save the best estimates
in files and examine the most common data among them. That is added to our database and the cycle continue, we'll get better over time!
