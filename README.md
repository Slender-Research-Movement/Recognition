# What Is A Slender?

A Slender is a description for a specific type of avatar that some players have equipped, and they are often compared to the notorious Slender Man. They have the same tall and thin look as this fictional supernatural character. Usually, these are male in form, but you will come across the occasional female Slender.

These players utilize the R15 scaling tools on their avatar, which gives them 15 parts (up from the usual six) that can be manipulated, allowing them to give their avatar this look. They also purchase the Robloxian 2.0 Package for 15 Robux due to its thinner appearance that is accentuated when using R15.

Personality
A Slender's personality in Roblox
There is no one-size-fits-all personality for a Slender, but there are a few stereotypes that are often associated with them. Some assume they are mean, but this is not true of every Slender you meet.

Others have noticed they often like to troll in games or prefer the online dating lifestyle (which is known as an Oder) where they actively search for online partners.

Style
Roblox Slender Style
Slenders have their own style, but it usually entails a lot of black clothing with pants and a long sleeve shirt. They also equip a dark hairstyle as well, and some even choose to add a black hat to complete the look.


Some might describe the aesthetic as punk or emo, as each player puts their own spin on this trend. A lot of players also enjoy adding wings of some sort to really make their Slender outfit pop.

A few of the accessories a Slender might have include:

Black Spiked Hair
Plain Black Shirt
Plain Black Pants
Stitchface
Korblox Items (which are some of the more expensive catalog items)
Who Created Them?
Slender by GoingLimited on Youtube in Roblox
It isn't really known how they came to be, but it is assumed that this was a style that many players copied from another, which is one reason why Roblox has Minecraft beat.

A few players thought it would be fun to represent this character in the game, and it eventually caught on when YouTubers, such as PinkAnt and GoingLimited, created videos that focused on this new trend.
