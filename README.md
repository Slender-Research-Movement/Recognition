## Slender Recognition

# What do we do?
This is an online database that helps scripts and functions alike recognize "Slenders" AKA Online Daters especially those in possesion of TikTok.

We use our current data to estimate Slenders in popular genre games such as, Murder Mistery Two, and Ragdoll Engine. With our scripts, we save the best estimates
in files and examine the most common data among them. That is added to our database and the cycle continue, we'll get better over time!
